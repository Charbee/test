                        <h2>STEP 1 – APPLY BY AUGUST 21.</h2>
                        <p>The application period opens on August 6th, and all you need is a topic you’re passionate about. Apply by filming a 1-minute video of you, speaking about your chosen topic. Tell us why it’s important to you and why the world should hear about it!</p>
                        <p>What we look on the video is (in order of importance):</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>1. Your enthusiasm and motivation</li>
                                <li>2. The importance of your message - why should the world hear it</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Only then will we look at your performing ability</p>
                        <p>Note that we’re very strict on the video length. 1:00 is okay, 1:01 is too long. So make it short and sweet!</p>
