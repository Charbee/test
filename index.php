        <!-- Arrow pointing down or some other indication to scroll down -->
        <!-- Image for step 1 -->
        <h1>STEP 1 – APPLY BY AUGUST 21.</h1> <!-- Primary text -->
        <p>The application period opens on August 6th, and all you need is a topic you’re passionate about. Apply by filming a 1-minute video of you, speaking about your chosen topic. Tell us why it’s important to you and why the world should hear about it!</p>
        <p>What we look on the video is (in order of importance):</p>
        <ol>
                <li> Your enthusiasm and motivation</li>
                <li> The importance of your message - why should the world hear it</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Only then will we look at your performing ability</p>
        <p>Note that we’re very strict on the video length. 1:00 is okay, 1:01 is too long. So make it short and sweet!</p>
        <p>Before sending out the application, please mark the dates on your calendar and try to make sure you’ll be able to attend each of them.</p>
        <p>We will inform all applicants on August 28.</p>

         <h1>Talk The Talk Backstage: we make people feel a little uncomfortable – but in a comfortable way!</h1> <!-- Big header --> 
         <p>Talk The Talk Backstage is a concept for open workshops dedicated to the local community. In spring 2018 we designed and conducted three open workshops in Helsinki for a group of 30 participants each. With the feedback from participants we are ready to improve our materials even further for open workshops in the coming months.</p>
         <!-- Image 2 -->
         <p>TTT Backstage is always a free event with the hands-on attitude: WE speak less, YOU do more. The event is planned to be as an active practicing platform for public speaking. The venue is informal and atmosphere is relaxed and friendly.</p>
         <!-- Image 3 -->
         <p>Everyone can organise TTT Backstage following our guidelines. If you want to organise or help hosting TTT Backstage, contact us thorugh info@talkthetalk.fi</p>
         <!-- TALENTS -->
         <p>Talk The Talk main event provides talents with the platform for getting stage time. Anyone who needs a speaker or a performer can contact talents directly - if they prefer so. Additionally, TTT team also receives queries for gigs and projects which we then share to our talents. After all it’s practice and experience that make the difference.</p>
